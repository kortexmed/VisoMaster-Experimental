# VisoMaster-Fusion mod

### Visomaster a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for face swapping and editing in images and videos. It utilizes AI to produce natural-looking results with minimal effort, making it ideal for both casual users and professionals.

This version integrates major features developed by the community to create a single, enhanced application. It is built upon the incredible work of the original VisoMaster developers, **@argenspin** and **@Alucard24**.

## Fusion Features

VisoMaster-Fusion includes all the great features of the original plus major enhancements from community mods:

-   **Job Manager & Batch Processing**: A complete UI to save workspace configurations as "jobs" and run them sequentially for unattended batch processing. Features segmented recording to combine multiple clips into a single output.
-   **VR180 Mode**: Process and swap faces in hemispherical 180-degree VR videos, with optimizations for memory and speed.
-   **Experimental Enhancements**: Gain finer control with features like "swap only best match," advanced texture transfer modes, improved AutoColor with mask testing, and deeper integration of occlusion masks (XSeg) for more precise results.
-   **New Models**: Includes the **GFPGAN-1024** face restorer and the  **ReF-LDM** reference-based denoiser.
-   **Virtual Camera Streaming**: Send the processed video output directly to a virtual camera for use in OBS, Twitch, Zoom, and other applications.

### **Prerequisites**
- All versions require 
  - CUDA - https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive
    Currently supported versions: 11.8 / 12.4 / 12.8 / 12.9
    Some newer GPUs (like rtx 50xx cards) need the newer CUDA version 12.9. Check the minimum supported cuda version for your GPU. Beside that you can choose any supported version.
  - CuDNN - https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
    Check the version support matrix and choose version based on your installed CUDA version (https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/backend/latest/reference/support-matrix.html)
  - FFmpeg 7.1 - ([see installation below]([https://github.com/asdf31jsa/VisoMaster-Experimental?tab=readme-ov-file#4-download-and-install-ffmpeg-711-method-1)))

- Portable Version: No other pre-requirements
- Non-Portable Version:
    -   **Git** ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
    -   **Miniconda** ([Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download))
        <br> or
    -   **uv** ([Installation choices])(https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

## **Installation Guide (VisoMaster-Fusion)**

### **Portable version**

Download only the Run_Portable.bat file from this repo (you don't need to clone the whole repo) from link below and put it in a new directory were you want to run VisoMaster from. Then just execute the bat file to run VisoMaster. Portable dependencies will be installed on the first run to portable-files directory.
- [Download - Start_Portable.bat](Start_Portable.bat)

You don't need any other steps from below for the portable version. Always start visomaster with Start_Portable.bat

### **Non-Portable - Installation Steps**

**1. Clone the Repository**
Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```sh
git clone <URL_TO_YOUR_VISOMASTER_FUSION_REPO>
```
```sh
cd VisoMaster
```
```sh
git checkout fusion
```

**2. Create and Activate a python Environment (Skip if you already have one)**


#### In case you like to use "anaconda"

```sh
conda create -n visomaster python=3.11 -y
```
```sh
conda activate visomaster
```
```sh
pip install uv
```

### In case you like to use "uv" directly

```sh
uv venv --python 3.11
```
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install requirements**
```
uv pip install -r requirements_cu129.txt
```

#### **4. Download and install ffmpeg 7.1.1 [Method 1]**
  - FFmpeg is required for video processing and to be able to record and save your swapped results.
  - **You won't be able to save any of your swapped videos without installing FFmpeg!**
```sh
winget install -e --id Gyan.FFmpeg --version 7.1.1
```

***4.1** Alternatively if you prefer it in your environment only [OPTIONAL Method 2]*
  - ***Not needed if you used winget to install it***
  - *Might be not as reliably found from installed Packages or VisoMaster itself.*
  - *If you chose this method and are getting errors about missing FFmpeg, I'd suggest using winget. But you have a third option below too.*
  - *Make sure your VisoMaster environment is active.*
```sh
conda activate visomaster
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```

***4.2** Manual Installation [OPTIONAL Method 3]*
  - ***Also not needed if you used winget or chose to install it into your environment
  - *If option one and two didn't work for you for whatever reason, you can install it manually.*
  - *Download the .zip from [here](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-n7.1-latest-win64-gpl-7.1.zip)*
  - *Extract the `bin` folder from the FFmpeg archive to `C:\Tools\ffmpeg\` (or wherever want, just remember it).*
  - *Add `C:\Tools\ffmpeg\bin` to PATH automatically using PowerShell. (the bin folder with its content is the important part here!)*
    > ***Note:** REMEMBER If you chose a different location to extract to, adjust the path accordingly, or this will have no effect!*
    
    *Open ***PowerShell as Administrator*** and run:*
```sh
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\ffmpeg\bin", "Machine")
```



**5. Download required models**
```sh
python download_models.py
```

**6. Run the Application**

Once everything is set up, start the application: 
- by opening the **Start.bat** file (for Windows)
or 
Activate conda or uv environment in a terminal in the visomaster directory:

```
# If you use Anaconda
conda activate visomaster

# If you use uv only
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Start visomaster
python main.py
```


**6.1 Update to latest code state**
```sh
cd VisoMaster
git pull
```

---

**6. Install ffmpeg**

In Windows - Either via:

- powershell command: "winget install -e --id Gyan.FFmpeg --version 7.1.1"

<br>or

- Download ffmpeg zip: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/packages/ffmpeg-7.1.1-essentials_build.zip
- Unzip it somewhere
- Add "\<unzipped ffmpeg path>\bin" folder to your Windows environment PATH variable

## How to use the Job Manager
1.  Set up your workspace as you normally would before recording (select source/target faces, adjust settings, etc.).
2.  In the Job Manager widget, click the **"Save Job"** button.
3.  Give your job a name. You can also choose whether to use this name for the final output file.
4.  The job will appear in the list. Set up more jobs if you wish.
5.  To process, select one or more jobs and click **"Process Selected"**, or click **"Process All"** to run the entire queue.
6.  Processing will begin automatically. A pop-up will notify you when all jobs are complete.
